  BMI is a scale that measures a person's leanness or corpulence based on their height and weight. 
  
  It is used to estimate tissue mass. It is commonly used as a general measure of whether a person's body weight is appropriate for their height. 
  
  Specifically, the BMI value is used to determine whether a person is underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese, based on where the number falls within the range.
